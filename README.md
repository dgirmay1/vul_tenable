<h1>Vulnerability Management Lab (Tenable and Azure)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This lab demonstrates the fundamentals of vulnerability management using Tenableâ€™s vulnerability scanning tools in a Azure environment.


<h3>Tasks performed</h3>

- <b>Successfully designed and implemented a hands-on vulnerability management lab environment utilizing Tenable (cloud-based platform) and Microsoft Azure.</b>
  
- <b>Created and configured a Windows 10 virtual machine in Azure to serve as the target for vulnerability scanning.</b>
  
- <b>Utilized Tenable to perform comprehensive vulnerability scans, identifying outdated software, misconfigurations, and compliance violations (DISA STIGs).</b>
  
- <b>Analyzed scan results to understand the nature and severity of identified vulnerabilities, utilizing resources like ChatGPT and STIG Viewer/Event Sentry for deeper insights.</b>
  
- <b>Demonstrated practical experience in vulnerability remediation by addressing identified issues, including uninstalling vulnerable software and modifying system configurations.</b>

- <b>Conducted multiple scan cycles to verify the effectiveness of remediation efforts and track the improvement in the security posture of the virtual machine.</b>

- <b>Gained practical experience with industry-standard vulnerability management tools and processes, enhancing skills relevant to cybersecurity analyst and related roles.</b>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>
